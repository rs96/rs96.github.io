# rs96.github.io

Simple single page portfolio to demostrate tech and be a handful of links to things about me!

The App is hosted on Github at https://rs96.github.io

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn test`

### `yarn run build`

### `yarn run eject`

### `yarn run deploy`

## Publishing the React App to Github Pages

The app is built and deployed by using `yarn run deploy`.

This runs the `gh-pages -d build` command which utilises the `yarn run build` command to create the build of the app, then takes these build contents and structures them so that the Github Pages magic hosts it at https://rs96.github.io

Lovely!
